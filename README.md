<h4 style="text-align: center;">This is still relatively untested, and bugs are likely to occur. You should only use this if you're comfortable with programming and fixing the bugs yourself. I will provide limited support and cannot guarantee that any bugs or issues will be fixed within a typical timeframe.</h4>

# Bubble MDT & Dispatch

A police MDT with built-in dispatch functionalities. The MDT consists of the following pages:

- Dashboard
- Profiles
- Incidents
- Reports
- Vehicles
- Dispatch
- Roster
- Charges

# Frameworks

- [qbx_core](https://github.com/Qbox-project/qbx_core)

# Dependencies

- [oxmysql](https://github.com/overextended/oxmysql)
- [ox_lib](https://github.com/overextended/ox_lib)

# Installation

- Install all the dependencies and have them started before bub-mdt
- Import the SQL provided
- Drag and drop the resource into your resources folder
- Add `start bub-mdt` to your `server.cfg` file

# Credits

Without the creation of the following resources, this MDT would not have seen the light of day, as this MDT is heavily inspired by these:

- [ox_mdt](https://github.com/overextended/ox_mdt) - Dispatch, Some events and function, Code structure and data flow

# Feature Request, Issue Reporting & Contribution

- Contributions are always welcome - Open a pull request.
- Found a bug? Open an issue.
- Want a feature implemented? Open an issue.

# The resource state

- LUA part needs some refactoring.
- A lot of the UI needs to be refactored, more modular and simply be optimized.
- The drivers license points system needs to be revamped, as of right now it does not function properly.
- Probably a lot more which i have forgotten about, but i guess it will get mentioned if people end up using this MDT.
